2 A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps developers manage and track changes to source code or files over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project, keeps history of changes, and makes it possible to restore previous versions when needed.



3 We use a VCS because: To track who changed what and when



To avoid overwriting each other’s work in team projects



To go back to older versions if something breaks



To collaborate efficiently in software development



To maintain a clear history of project progress



Without VCS, managing code in teams would be slow, confusing, and error-prone.
